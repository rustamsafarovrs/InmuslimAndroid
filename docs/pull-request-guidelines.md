# Pull Request Guidelines

## Main Branch

The `develop` branch represents the latest version. This is what you want to fork and base your feature branch on.

## Branch Naming

Branch names should use the following pattern.

`fix/` = fix an existing issue

`update/` = update an existing feature

`add/` = add a new feature

`remove/` = remove an existing feature


Some examples are `add/sleep-timer` and `fix/notifications-crash`.

## Raise a Pull Request

When you are ready, please, spend time crafting a good Pull Request, since it will have a huge impact on the work of reviewers and testers.
